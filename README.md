# SimpleSearchEngine

Overview:
This project is focused on developing a basic search engine through a series of incremental stages. The first three stages involve creating an in-memory document store, implementing a HashTable for efficient data management, and adding undo functionality using a stack.

Features:
In-Memory Document Store: Manage and retrieve documents stored in memory.
HashTable: Improve data retrieval with a HashTable for efficient key-value storage.
Undo Functionality: Implement a stack and functional programming to enable undoing actions, enhancing data integrity.

Objective:
The goal is to apply fundamental data structures and algorithms in a practical scenario, simulating a real-world application like a search engine.

Technology Stack:
Java, Maven, JUnit
