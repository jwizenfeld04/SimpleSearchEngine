# SimpleSearchEngine

This repository contains the implementation of a simple search engine as part of the Data Structures course (COM 1320) at Yeshiva University, Spring 2024. The project is divided into six stages, each focusing on different aspects of data structures and memory management.

## Project Overview

The project involves building a simple search engine through multiple stages. Each stage introduces new data structures and concepts, building on the previous stages. The final stage integrates two-tier storage, combining RAM and disk storage using a BTree.

## Learning Goals

1. Implement various data structures, including HashTable, Trie, and BTree.
2. Develop a modular and scalable software design.
3. Gain experience with Maven for project management and dependency resolution.
4. Apply functional programming concepts in Java.
5. Implement memory management techniques.

## Requirements

- **Java Version**: Oracle JDK 17
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Dependencies**: GSON library for JSON serialization/deserialization

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: In-Memory Document Store

- **Description**: Implement a simple in-memory document store using a HashMap to store documents that can be retrieved using a URI. The store should support storing documents as either text (String) or binary data (byte[]).

### Stage 2: HashTable Implementation

- **Description**: Implement a HashTable from scratch using separate chaining for collision handling. Replace the HashMap in the DocumentStore with this custom HashTable to store documents.

### Stage 3: Undo Support

- **Description**: Add undo functionality to the DocumentStore. This involves supporting two types of undo operations: undoing the last action and undoing the last action on a specific document. A command stack is used to manage these undo operations.

### Stage 4: Keyword Search Using a Trie

- **Description**: Implement keyword and prefix search functionalities using a Trie. This allows users to search for documents based on keywords, prefixes, and metadata. The Trie data structure is used to efficiently support these search operations.

### Stage 5: Memory Management with a Heap

- **Description**: Implement memory management using a MinHeap to track document usage. Introduce limits on the number of documents and the amount of memory that can be used. When limits are exceeded, the least recently used documents are removed from memory.

### Stage 6: Two-Tier Storage with BTree

- **Description**: Extend memory management by implementing a BTree for two-tier storage (RAM and disk). When memory limits are exceeded, documents are moved to disk and retrieved as needed. This stage involves serializing and deserializing documents to and from disk.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:jwizenfeld04/SimpleSearchEngine.git
   cd SimpleSearchEngine
   ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Test each stage with Maven**:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```
